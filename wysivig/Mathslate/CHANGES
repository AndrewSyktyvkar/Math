Version 1.1

This release adds to the original 1.0 version some technical improvements.

    1. The editor now supports MathJax Output modes NativeMML and SVG
    in addittion to HTML-CSS.  It will use the current output jax to
    display all mathematics.

    2. The TeX tool now has a more robust XML parser so that it should be
    able to convert any TeX expression supported by the MathJax
    configuration to work within the editor.

    3. JSON to MathML conversions has be improved to provide more complete
    MathML configuration of editor.

    4. The default configuration has been updated slightly to utilize
    some of the improvements.

    5. Some improvements have been made in the API to make it more easily 
    used in other plugins.

tinymce_mathslate
=================

Mathslate is a graphical tool for constructing mathematics within
Moodle. This plugin adds the tool to TinyMCE version 3. Other plugins
are required for Atto or TinyMCE4. Install this directory as a
subdirectory of the Moodle directory lib/editor/tinymce/plugins with
the name mathslate. Then visit the administrators notification page to
install the plugin to the database and adjust the settings.

This plugin requires MathJax to run. If MathJax is configured on the
Moodle site either within theme or using MathJaxloader, Mathslate is
able to use it. If the TeX notation filter is used instead of MathJax,
then the url to load MathJax must be set in the admin setting so that
Mathslate can load MathJax on demand. For more information about MathJax
see mathjax.org.
